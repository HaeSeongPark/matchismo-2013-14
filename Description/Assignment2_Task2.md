## Required Task
-  Add a button which will re-deal all of the cards (i.e. start a new game). It should reset the score (and anything else in the UI that makes sense). In a real game, we’d probably want to ask the user if he or she is “sure” before aborting the game in process to re-deal, but for this assignment, you can assume the user always knows what he or she is doing when they hit this button.

   - make button and hook up the button to CardGameVC with IBAction which is touchedDealButton:sender. In that method, do re-deal!
