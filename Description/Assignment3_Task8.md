## Required Task
- 8. Your Set game should also report (mis)matches like Required Task #5 in the last assignment, but you’ll have to enhance this feature (to use NSAttributedString) to make it capable of working for both the Set and Playing Card games.

##### When I use a header "class someName..." in code block for some code, that means the following code is within the scope of the class named 'someName'.

##### Basically I borrowed m2mtech idea.

## My Description
 - When we click the set card, description text will be like 'circle red solid 3'. Because we did hard code for set card model. For example validshape is "circle, triangle, square" literally not shape like "●,▲,■".

 - We can choose change set card content but. it's a lot of work. We have to change existing code CardGameVC, Card, PlayingCard etc. I think it's more sensible than folloing. But it just hassle.

 - m2mtech adjusted set stuff. See m2mtech description and code.
