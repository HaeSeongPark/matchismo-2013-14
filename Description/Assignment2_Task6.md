## Required Task
-  6. Change the UI of your game to have 30 cards instead of 12. See Hints about the size of cards.

## related Hint
- 8. To make 30 cards fit, you’ll have to make them smaller (oh, maybe 40x60 or so). The cards will strongly want to be their natural size (based on the background image sizes) while working with them in Xcode, so you’ll have to hold down the Command key while resizing them.


1. hold all existing cards and go to the size inspector then change the view size with 40 and height 60. which is nature size according to Hint 8.

2. make sure two things, first, adjust font size of cards properly. Becuase cards size is small. second, hook up the added cards to cardButtons property which is IBOutletCollection
