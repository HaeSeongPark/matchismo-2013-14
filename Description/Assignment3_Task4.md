## Required Task
- 4. Use a UITabBarController to present the two games in your UI in separate tabs.

## My Solution
 - In main.storyboard,
 - Copy the PlayingCardGameVC
 - have it SetCardGameVC class. 
 - embed PlayCardGameVC and SetCardGameVC in UITabBarController
 - move view stuff covered tab properly
 - remove segment in SetCardGameVC. Becuase SET is 3 Cards match basically.
